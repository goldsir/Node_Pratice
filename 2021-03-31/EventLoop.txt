The Event Loop is one of the most important aspects to understand about Node.js

Node.js can be asynchronous and have non-blocking I/O.

The Node.js JavaScript code runs on a single thread. There is just one thing happening at a time.

This is a limitation that's actually very helpful, 
as it simplifies a lot how you program without worrying about concurrency issues.

The call stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) stack.
